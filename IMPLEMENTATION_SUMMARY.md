# FinCore Frontend Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented all the core frontend features for FinCore as requested. The application now includes a complete financial management system with Dashboard, Categories, Incomes, Expenses, and Reports functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dashboard Page** (`/dashboard`)

  - Current Balance (blue/orange depending on positive/negative)
- Category breakdowns showing:
  - Income by category with progress bars and percentages
  - Expenses by category with progress bars and percentages
- Automatic refresh button
- Real-time data fetching from `/api/report/`

### 2. **Categories Page** (`/categories`)
- Lists all categories grouped by their parent (Income/Expense)
- Add new category form with fields:
  - Category Name
  - Parent Category (dropdown)
  - Description (optional)
- Delete functionality (root categories are protected)
- Visual hierarchy showing subcategories under parents
- Fetches from `/api/categories/`

### 3. **Incomes Page** (`/incomes`)
- Data table displaying all incomes with columns:
  - Date
  - Category
  - Amount (green color)
  - Description
  - Actions (Delete button)
- Add income form with fields:
  - Amount (number input)
  - Date (date picker, defaults to today)
  - Category (dropdown - filtered to Income categories)
  - Description (optional)

- Fetches from `/api/incomes/`

### 4. **Expenses Page** (`/expenses`)
- Data table displaying all expenses with columns:
  - Date

### 5. **Reports Page** (`/reports`)

## Navigation Structure
When authenticated, users can access:
- Home → Quick access to all features
- Dashboard → Financial overview
- Categories → Manage income/expense categories
- Incomes → Track income transactions
- Expenses → Track expense transactions
- Reports → Detailed financial reports

## API Integration
All pages integrate with the backend API endpoints:
- `GET /api/categories/` - Fetch all categories
- `POST /api/categories/` - Create new category
- `DELETE /api/categories/` - Delete category
- `GET /api/incomes/` - Fetch all incomes
- `POST /api/incomes/` - Create new income
- `DELETE /api/incomes/` - Delete income
- `GET /api/expenses/` - Fetch all expenses
- `POST /api/expenses/` - Create new expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/` - Delete expense
- `GET /api/report/` - Fetch financial report

## Next Steps
To use the application:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Register/login to access the features
4. Create categories first (under Income and Expense roots)
5. Add income and expense transactions
6. View reports and dashboard for insights

The application is fully functional and ready for use!
